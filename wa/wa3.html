    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Earth is our home planet and the only known place in the universe confirmed to host life. With a vast range of biodiversity, the Earth's surface is mainly covered with water and is surrounded by a life-supporting atmosphere.</p>

    <h2 id="physical-characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>The Earth is the fifth-largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 12,742 km. It features a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, and oceans. Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, which is critical for life as we know it.</p>

    <h2 id="orbit-and-rotation">Orbit and Rotation</h2>
    <p>The Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, which defines our year. It has a tilted axis of rotation, resulting in seasonal changes throughout the year. The planet rotates once every 24 hours, creating the day-night cycle.</p>

    <h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
    <p>Earth's environment is suitable for a diverse range of ecosystems, from arid deserts to lush rainforests. It's the interactions between the Earth's land, ocean, atmosphere, and life that make it uniquely capable of supporting life.</p>
